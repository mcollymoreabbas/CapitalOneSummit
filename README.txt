Hi! I'm Mia Collymore Abbas, and this is my News Website. My biggest challenge while doing this was all the CORS errors that I kept receiving no matter what I did, even after we got the Business API Keys. I spent so so much time on this, my mum thought I was going to drive myself crazy, I was really ready to give up, but then I found a repository that showed me a workaround, and it's linked in the comments. Which is very lucky for me because I hate leaving projects unfinished, especially because I was so so excited to get a chance for this program through CapitalOne. All the code I found from StackOverflow and stuff is linked in the comments. Then I made a search bar, that was my second difficulty, it wasn't submitting the way I wanted it to. It can only accept the words in the search bar if you didn't hit enter. I tried all these different "keyup" things, but alas. 
Then I just got to focus on aesthetics and stuff through HTML and CSS, which was much more fun and gratifying to do. The website isn't as pretty as ones I've made in the past, but I think that the layout is the most conducive for showing all three categories at once.
